# (1) Go to BigQuery console and create a dataset named 'demos'

# (2) In one CloudShell window, cd to CPB104/publish and type in:
        cd courses/streaming/publish   
        ./send_sensor_data.py --speedFactor=60

# (3) In another CloudShell window, launch a DataFlow job:
        cd courses/streaming/process/sandiego
        ./run_oncloud.sh cloud-training-demos cloud-training-demos CurrentConditions
        
# (4) Go to Cloud Console and view new job. Wait for the last step to show some activity (like 1 min or 3 events/second)

# (5) Go to BigQuery console and issue this query (make sure you have selected the standard SQL option)
SELECT
  s.*
FROM
  demos.current_conditions AS s
JOIN (
  SELECT
    sensorId,
    MAX(timestamp) AS timestamp
  FROM
    demos.current_conditions
  GROUP BY
    sensorId) AS c
ON
  s.sensorId = c.sensorId
  AND s.timestamp = c.timestamp

# (6) save the above as a view in BigQuery

# (7) In DataStudio, connect to this view to create a dashboard

# For average speed, same process except that the classname in step 3 is AverageSpeeds and the tablename in step 5 is now demos.average_speeds

# For accidents, use AccidentAlert and demos.accidents
