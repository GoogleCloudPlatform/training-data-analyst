# The Dockerfile and other source for this daemonset are in
# https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cos-gpu-installer
#
# This is the same as ../../daemonset.yaml except that it assumes that the
# docker image is present on the node instead of downloading from GCR. This
# allows easier upgrades because GKE can preload the correct image on the
# node and the daemonset can just use that image.
