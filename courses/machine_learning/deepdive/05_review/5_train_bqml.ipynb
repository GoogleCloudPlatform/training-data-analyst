    "\n",
    "BQML is a great option when a linear model will suffice, or when you want a quick benchmark to beat. But, for more complex models such as neural networks you will need to pull the data out of BigQuery and into an ML Framework like TensorFlow. That being said, what BQML gives up in complexity, it gains in ease of use. \n",
