    "All these factors seem to play a part in the baby's weight. Male babies are heavier on average than female babies. Teenaged and older moms tend to have lower-weight babies. Twins, triplets, etc. are lower weight than single births. Preemies weigh in lower as do babies born to single moms. In addition, it is important to check whether you have enough data (number of babies) for each input value. Otherwise, the model prediction against input values that doesn't have enough data may not be reliable.\n",
