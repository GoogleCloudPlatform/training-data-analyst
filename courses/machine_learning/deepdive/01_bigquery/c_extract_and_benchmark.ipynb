    "In the previous notebook we demonstrated how to do ML in BigQuery. However BQML is limited to linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For advanced ML we need to pull the data out of BigQuery and load it into a ML Framework, in our case TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "While TensorFlow [can read from BigQuery directly](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/cloud/BigQueryReader), the performance is slow. The best practice is to first stage the BigQuery files as .csv files, and then read the .csv files into TensorFlow. \n",
    "\n",
    "The .csv files can reside on local disk if we're training locally, but if we're training in the cloud we'll need to move the .csv files to the cloud, in our case Google Cloud Storage."

We need to know that our chosen set of hyperparameters will work well for data we haven't seen before because in production, that will be the case. For this reason, we create a third dataset that we never use during the model development process. We only evaluate on this once our model development is finished. Data scientists don't always create a test dataset (aka holdout dataset), but to be thorough you should.\n",
