    "\n",
    "This limits your serving flexibility. For example, lets say you want to be able to serve this model locally (offline) on a mobile phone. How would you do it? It's non trivial to execute python code on Android. Plus if your vocabulary tokenization ever changed you'd need to update all the clients or else they would be out of sync with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way would be to have all of our serving pre-processing to be done using native Tensorflow operations. This way we can take advantage of Tensorflow's hardware agnostic execution engine, and leverage the engineering efforts the Tensorflow team put into making sure our code works whether we're running on a server, mobile, or an embedded device!"
