We need to convert both the dayofweek and hourofday features to strings because the model (Neural Network) will automatically treat any integer as a numerical value rather than a categorical value.  Thus, if not cast as a string, the dayofweek feature will be interpreted as numeric values (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) and hour ofday will also be interpreted as numeric values (e.g. the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59 and ends at 24:00).  As such, there is no way to distinguish the \"feature cross\" of hourofday and dayofweek \"numerically\".
