    "Note:  BQML by default assumes that numbers are numeric features, and strings are categorical features.  We need to convert both the dayofweek and hourofday features to strings because the model (Neural Network) will automatically treat any integer as a numerical value rather than a categorical value.  Thus, if not cast as a string, the dayofweek feature will be interpreted as numeric values (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) and hour ofday will also be interpreted as numeric values (e.g. the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59 and ends at 24:00).  As such, there is no way to distinguish the \"feature cross\" of hourofday and dayofweek \"numerically\".  Casting the dayofweek and hourofday as strings ensures that each element will be treated like a label and will get its own coefficient associated with it."

    "### Final Model:  Apply the TRANSFORM clause and L2 Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we perform our prediction, we should encapsulate the entire feature set in a TRANSFORM clause.  BigQuery ML now supports defining data transformations during model creation, which will be automatically applied during prediction and evaluation. This is done through the TRANSFORM clause in the existing CREATE MODEL statement. By using the TRANSFORM clause, user specified transforms during training will be automatically applied during model serving (prediction, evaluation, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we are using the TRANSFORM clause to separate out the raw input data from the TRANSFORMED features.  The input columns of the TRANSFORM clause is the query_expr (AS SELECT part).  The output columns of TRANSFORM from select_list are used in training. These transformed columns are post-processed with standardization for numerics and one-hot encoding for categorical variables by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of encapsulating features in the TRANSFORM clause is the client code doing the PREDICT doesn't change, e.g. our model improvement is transparent to client code. Note that the TRANSFORM clause MUST be placed after the CREATE statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### [L2 Regularization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#L2_regularization) \n",
    "Sometimes, the training RMSE is quite reasonable, but the evaluation RMSE illustrate more error. Given the severity of the delta between the EVALUATION RMSE and the TRAINING RMSE, it may be an indication of overfitting. When we do feature crosses, we run into the risk of overfitting (for example, when a particular day-hour combo doesn't have enough taxi rides).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning or statistics model is tailored to a particular dataset and is unable to generalize to other datasets. This usually happens in complex models, like deep neural networks.  Regularization is a process of introducing additional information in order to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will apply L2 Regularization to the final model.  As a reminder, a regression model that uses the L1 regularization technique is called Lasso Regression while a regression model that uses the L2 Regularization technique is called Ridge Regression.  The key difference between these two is the penalty term.  Lasso shrinks the less important feature’s coefficient to zero, thus removing some features altogether.  Ridge regression adds “squared magnitude” of coefficient as a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, L1 limits the size of the coefficients. L1 can yield sparse models (i.e. models with few coefficients); Some coefficients can become zero and eliminated. \n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization adds an L2 penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. L2 will not yield sparse models and all coefficients are shrunk by the same factor (none are eliminated). \n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization terms are ‘constraints’ by which an optimization algorithm must ‘adhere to’ when minimizing the loss function, apart from having to minimize the error between the true y and the predicted ŷ.  This in turn reduces model complexity, making our model simpler. A simpler model can reduce the chances of overfitting."
