We need to set the `Training budget` which is the maxmimum number of node hours to spend training our model. Thankfully, if improvement stops before that, then the training will stop and you'll only be charged for the actual node hours you used. For this dataset, I got decent results with a budget of just 1 to 3 node hours.

It really shows you the amazing power of AutoML!
