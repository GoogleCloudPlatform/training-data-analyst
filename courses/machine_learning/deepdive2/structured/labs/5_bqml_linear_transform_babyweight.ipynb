    "## Lab Task #3: Model 3:  Apply the TRANSFORM clause and L2 Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we perform our prediction, we should encapsulate the entire feature set in a TRANSFORM clause.  BigQuery ML now supports defining data transformations during model creation, which will be automatically applied during prediction and evaluation. This is done through the TRANSFORM clause in the existing CREATE MODEL statement. By using the TRANSFORM clause, user specified transforms during training will be automatically applied during model serving (prediction, evaluation, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we are using the TRANSFORM clause to separate out the raw input data from the TRANSFORMED features.  The input columns of the TRANSFORM clause is the query_expr (AS SELECT part).  The output columns of TRANSFORM from select_list are used in training. These transformed columns are post-processed with standardization for numerics and one-hot encoding for categorical variables by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of encapsulating features in the TRANSFORM clause is the client code doing the PREDICT doesn't change, e.g. our model improvement is transparent to client code. Note that the TRANSFORM clause MUST be placed after the CREATE statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### [L2 Regularization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#L2_regularization) \n",
    "Sometimes, the training RMSE is quite reasonable, but the evaluation RMSE illustrate more error. Given the severity of the delta between the EVALUATION RMSE and the TRAINING RMSE, it may be an indication of overfitting. When we do feature crosses, we run into the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning or statistics model is tailored to a particular dataset and is unable to generalize to other datasets. This usually happens in complex models, like deep neural networks.  Regularization is a process of introducing additional information in order to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will apply L2 Regularization to the model 3.  As a reminder, a regression model that uses the L1 regularization technique is called Lasso Regression while a regression model that uses the L2 Regularization technique is called Ridge Regression.  The key difference between these two is the penalty term.  Lasso shrinks the less important feature’s coefficient to zero thus, removing some features altogether.  Ridge regression adds “squared magnitude” of coefficient as a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization adds an L1 penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. In other words, it limits the size of the coefficients. L1 can yield sparse models (i.e. models with few coefficients); Some coefficients can become zero and eliminated. Lasso regression uses this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization adds an L2 penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. L2 will not yield sparse models and all coefficients are shrunk by the same factor (none are eliminated). Ridge regression and SVMs use this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization terms are ‘constraints’ by which an optimization algorithm must ‘adhere to’ when minimizing the loss function, apart from having to minimize the error between the true y and the predicted ŷ.  This in turn reduces model complexity, making our model simpler. A simpler model can reduce the chances of overfitting."
