    "We will create and evaluate a DNN model using BigQuery ML, with and without feature engineering using BigQuery's ML.TRANSFORM and calculate predictions with BigQuery's ML.PREDICT. If you need a refresher, you can go back and look how we made a baseline model in the notebook [BQML Baseline Model](../solutions/3a_bqml_baseline_babyweight.ipynb) or how we combined linear models with feature engineering in the notebook [BQML Linear Models with Feature Engineering](../solutions/3b_bqml_linear_transform_babyweight.ipynb).\n",
