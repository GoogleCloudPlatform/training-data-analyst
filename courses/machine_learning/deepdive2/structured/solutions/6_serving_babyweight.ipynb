    "The `@app.route()` decorator defines a function to handle web reqests. Let's say our website is `www.example.com`.

    "So, when a user pings our server with `www.example.com/predict`, they would use `@app.route(\"/predict\", methods=[\"POST\"])` to make a prediction. The data that gets sent over the internet isn't a dictionary, but a string like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`name1=value1&name2=value2` where `name` corresponds to the `name` on the input tag of our html form, and the value is what the user entered. Thankfully, Flask makes it easy to transform this string into a dictionary with `request.form.to_dict()`, but we still need to transform the data into a format our model expects. We've done this with the `gender2str` and the `plurality2str` utility functions.\n",
