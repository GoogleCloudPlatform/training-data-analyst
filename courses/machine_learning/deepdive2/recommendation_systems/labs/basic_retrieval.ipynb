    "## Introduction\n",
    "Real-world recommender systems are often composed of two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The retrieval stage is responsible for selecting an initial set of hundreds of candidates from all possible candidates. The main objective of this model is to efficiently weed out all candidates that the user is not interested in. Because the retrieval model may be dealing with millions of candidates, it has to be computationally efficient.\n",
    "2. The ranking stage takes the outputs of the retrieval model and fine-tunes them to select the best possible handful of recommendations. Its task is to narrow down the set of items the user may be interested in to a shortlist of likely candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to focus on the first stage, retrieval. If you are interested in the ranking stage, have a look at our [ranking](basic_ranking) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval models are often composed of two sub-models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A query model computing the query representation (normally a fixed-dimensionality embedding vector) using query features.\n",
    "2. A candidate model computing the candidate representation (an equally-sized vector) using the candidate features\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of the two models are then multiplied together to give a query-candidate affinity score, with higher scores expressing a better match between the candidate and the query.\n",

    "### The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The Movielens dataset is a classic dataset from the [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) research group at the University of Minnesota. It contains a set of ratings given to movies by a set of users, and is a workhorse of recommender system research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be treated in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It can be interpreted as expressesing which movies the users watched (and rated), and which they did not. This is a form of implicit feedback, where users' watches tell us which things they prefer to see and which they'd rather not see.\n",
    "2. It can also be seen as expressesing how much the users liked the movies they did watch. This is a form of explicit feedback: given that a user watched a movie, we can tell roughly how much they liked by looking at the rating they have given.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are focusing on a retrieval system: a model that predicts a set of movies from the catalogue that the user is likely to watch. Often, implicit data is more useful here, and so we are going to treat Movielens as an implicit system. This means that every movie a user watched is a positive example, and every movie they have not seen is an implicit negative example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each learning objective will correspond to a __#TODO__ in the notebook where you will complete the notebook cell's code before running. Refer to the [solution](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/machine_learning/deepdive2/recommendation_systems/solutions/basic_retrieval.ipynb) for reference.\n"

It can be mediated by model regularization and use of user and movie features that help the model generalize better to unseen data.\n",

This approach is relatively common in the recommender systems literature, but we don't follow it in these notebooks. If not recommending past watches is important, we should expect appropriately specified models to learn this behaviour automatically from past user history and contextual information. Additionally, it is often appropriate to recommend the same item multiple times (say, an evergreen TV series or a regularly purchased item)."
