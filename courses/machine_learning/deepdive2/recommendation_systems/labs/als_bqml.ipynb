    "Collaborative filtering provides a way to generate product recommendations for users, or user targeting for products. The starting point is a table, <b>movielens.ratings</b>, with three columns: a user id, an item id, and the rating that the user gave the product. This table can be sparse -- users don’t have to rate all products. Then, based on just the ratings, the technique finds similar users and similar products and determines the rating that a user would give an unseen product. Then, we can recommend the products with the highest predicted ratings to users, or target products at users with the highest predicted ratings."
