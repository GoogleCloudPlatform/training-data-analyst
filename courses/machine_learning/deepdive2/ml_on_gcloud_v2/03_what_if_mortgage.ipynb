    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use the [What-if Tool (WIT)](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/) on a deployed [Cloud AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/) model. The What-If Tool provides an easy-to-use interface for expanding understanding of black-box classification and regression ML models. With the plugin, you can perform inference on a large set of examples and immediately visualize the results in a variety of ways. Additionally, examples can be edited manually or programmatically and re-run through the model in order to see the results of the changes. It contains tooling for investigating model performance and fairness over subsets of a dataset.  The purpose of the tool is to give people a simple, intuitive, and powerful way to explore and investigate trained ML models through a visual interface with absolutely no code required.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)](https://xgboost.ai/) is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. In prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.) artificial neural networks tend to outperform all other algorithms or frameworks. However, when it comes to small-to-medium structured/tabular data, decision tree based algorithms are considered best-in-class right now. Please see the chart below for the evolution of tree-based algorithms over the years.\n",

    "Developing machine learning models in Python often requires the use of NumPy arrays.  Recall that NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays.  NumPy arrays are efficient data structures for working with data in Python, and machine learning models like those in the scikit-learn library, and deep learning models like those in the Keras library, expect input data in the format of NumPy arrays and make predictions in the format of NumPy arrays.  As such, it is common to need to save NumPy arrays to file.  Note that the data info reveals the following datatypes dtypes: float64(8), int16(1), int8(1), uint8(34) -- and no strings or \"objects\". So, let's now load the features and labels into numpy arrays.   "

You'll now see performance on the two subsets of your data: the \"0\" slice shows when the loan is not for a home purchase, and the \"1\" slice is for when the loan is for a home purchase. Notice that the model's false positive rate is much higher on loans for home purchases. If you expand the rows to look at the confusion matrices, you can see that the model predicts \"approved\" more often for home purchase loans.\n",

If you select the \"Demographic parity\" button, then the two thresholds will be adjusted so that the model predicts \"approved\" for a similar percentage of applicants in both slices. What does this do to the accuracy, false positives and false negatives for each slice?\n"
