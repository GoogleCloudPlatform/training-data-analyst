    "In the <a href=\"3_tf_hub_transfer_learning.ipynb\">previous notebook</a>, we learned how to do transfer learning with [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub). In this notebook, we're going to kick up our training speed with [TPUs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tpu).\n",

    "In order to train on a TPU, we'll need to set up a python module for training. The skeleton for this has already been built out in `tpu_models` with the data processing functions from the pevious lab copied into <a href=\"tpu_models/trainer/util.py\">util.py</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the model building and training functions are pulled into <a href=\"tpu_models/trainer/model.py\">model.py</a>. This is almost entirely the same as before, except the hub module path is now a variable to be provided by the user. We'll get into why in a bit, but first, let's take a look at the new `task.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've added five command line arguments which are standard for cloud training of a TensorFlow model: `epochs`, `steps_per_epoch`, `train_path`, `eval_path`, and `job-dir`. There are two new arguments for TPU training: `tpu_address` and `hub_path`\n",
    "\n",
    "`tpu_address` is going to be our TPU name as it appears in [Compute Engine Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances). We can specify this name with the [ctpu up](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/ctpu-reference#up) command.\n",
    "\n",
    "`hub_path` is going to be a Google Cloud Storage path to a downloaded TensorFlow Hub module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other big difference is some code to deploy our model on a TPU. To begin, we'll set up a [TPU Cluster Resolver](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/cluster_resolver/TPUClusterResolver), which will help tensorflow communicate with the hardware to set up workers for training ([more on TensorFlow Cluster Resolvers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/cluster_resolver/ClusterResolver)). Once the resolver [connects to](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/config/experimental_connect_to_cluster) and [initializes](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/tpu/experimental/initialize_tpu_system) the TPU system, our Tensorflow Graphs can be initialized within a [TPU distribution strategy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/TPUStrategy), allowing our TensorFlow code to take full advantage of the TPU hardware capabilities."
