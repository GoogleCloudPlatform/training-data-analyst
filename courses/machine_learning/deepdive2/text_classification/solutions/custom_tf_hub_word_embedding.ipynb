    "# Custom TF-Hub Word Embedding with text2hub\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "  1. Learn how to deploy AI Hub Kubeflow pipeline.\n",
    "  1. Learn how to configure the run parameters for text2hub.\n",
    "  1. Learn how to inspect text2hub generated artifacts and word embeddings in TensorBoard.\n",
    "  1. Learn how to run TF 1.x generated hub module in TF 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-trained text embeddings such as TF-Hub modules are a great tool for building machine learning models for text features, since they capture relationships between words. These embeddings are generally trained on vast but generic text corpora like Wikipedia or Google News, which means that they are usually very good at representing generic text, but not so much when the text comes from a very specialized domain with unique vocabulary, such as in the medical field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem in particular that arises when applying a TF-Hub text module which was pre-trained on a generic corpus to specialized text is that all of the unique, domain-specific words will be mapped to the same “out-of-vocabulary” (OOV) vector. By doing so we lose a very valuable part of the text information, because for specialized texts the most informative words are often the words that are very specific to that special domain. Another issue is that of commonly misspelled words from text gathered from say, customer feedback. Applying a generic pre-trained embedding will send the misspelled word to the OOV vectors, losing precious information. However, by creating a TF-Hub module tailored to the texts coming from that customer feedback means that common misspellings present in your real customer data will be part of the embedding vocabulary and should be close by closeby to the original word in the embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn how to generate a text TF-hub module specific to a particular domain using the text2hub Kubeflow pipeline available on Google AI Hub. This pipeline takes as input a corpus of text stored in a GCS bucket and outputs a TF-Hub module to a GCS bucket. The generated TF-Hub module can then be reused both in TF 1.x or in TF 2.0 code by referencing the output GCS bucket path when loading the module. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first order of business will be to learn how to deploy a Kubeflow pipeline, namely text2hub, stored in AI Hub to a Kubeflow cluster. Then we will dig into the pipeline run parameter configuration and review the artifacts produced by the pipeline during its run. These artifacts are meant to help you assess how good the domain specific TF-hub module you generated is. In particular, we will  explore the embedding space visually using TensorBoard projector, which provides a tool to list the nearest neighbors to a given word in the embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, we will explain how to run the generated module both in TF 1.x and TF 2.0. Running the module in TF 2.0 will necessitate a small trick that’s useful to know in itself because it allows you to use all the TF 1.x modules in TF hub in TF 2.0 as a Keras layer. \n",
