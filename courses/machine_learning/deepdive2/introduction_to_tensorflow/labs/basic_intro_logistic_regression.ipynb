[Neural networks](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#neural_network) can find complex relationships between features and the label. It is a highly-structured graph, organized into one or more [hidden layers](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#hidden_layer). Each hidden layer consists of one or more [neurons](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#neuron). There are several categories of neural networks and this program uses a dense, or [fully-connected neural network](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#fully_connected_layer): the neurons in one layer receive input connections from *every* neuron in the previous layer. For example, Figure 2 illustrates a dense neural network consisting of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer:\n",

For example, a model that picked the correct species on half the input examples has an [accuracy](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#accuracy) of `0.5`. Figure 4 shows a slightly more effective model, getting 4 out of 5 predictions correct at 80% accuracy:\n",
