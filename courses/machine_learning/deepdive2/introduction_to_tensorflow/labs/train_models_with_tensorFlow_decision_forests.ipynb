    "\n",
    "1. Train a binary classification Random Forest on a dataset containing numerical, categorical and missing features.\n",
    "2. Evaluate the model on a test dataset and prepare the model for [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving).\n",
    "3. Examine the overall structure of the model and the importance of each feature.\n",
    "4. Re-train the model with a different learning algorithm (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) and use a different set of input features.\n",
    "5. Change the hyperparameters of the model.\n",
    "6. Preprocess the features and train a model for regression.\n",
    "7. Train a model for ranking.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to use TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF) library for the training, evaluation, interpretation and inference of Decision Forest models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Forests (DF) are a large family of Machine Learning algorithms for supervised classification, regression and ranking. As the name suggests, DFs use decision trees as a building block. Today, the two most popular DF training algorithms are [Random Forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) and [Gradient Boosted Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting). Both algorithms are ensemble techniques that use multiple decision trees, but differ on how they do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each learning objective will correspond to a __#TODO__ in this student lab notebook -- try to complete this notebook first and then review the [solution notebook](../solutions/train_models_with_tensorFlow_decision_forests.ipynb)."
