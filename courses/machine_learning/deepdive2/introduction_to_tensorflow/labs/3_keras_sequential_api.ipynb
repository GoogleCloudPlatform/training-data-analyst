The `steps` parameter determines the total number of steps before declaring the prediction round finished. Here since we have just one example, we set `steps=1` (setting `steps=None` would also work). Note, however, that if x is a `tf.data` dataset or a dataset iterator, and steps is set to None, predict will run until the input dataset is exhausted."
