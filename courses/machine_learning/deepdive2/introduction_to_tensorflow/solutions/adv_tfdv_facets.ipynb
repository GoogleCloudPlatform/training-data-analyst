    "Bias can manifest in any part of a typical machine learning pipeline, from an unrepresentative dataset, to learned model representations, to the way in which the results are presented to the user. Errors that result from this bias can disproportionately impact some users more than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "[TensorFlow Data Validation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/get_started) (TFDV) is one tool you can use to analyze your data to find potential problems in your data, such as missing values and data imbalances - that can lead to Fairness disparities.  The TFDV tool analyzes training and serving data to compute descriptive statistics, infer a schema, and detect data anomalies.  [Facets Overview](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/) provides a succinct visualization of these statistics for easy browsing. Both the TFDV and Facets are tools that are part of the [Fairness Indicators](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/fairness_indicators).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use TFDV to compute descriptive statistics that provide a quick overview of the data in terms of the features that are present and the shapes of their value distributions.  We use Facets Overview to visualize these statistics using the Civil Comments dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each learning objective will correspond to a __#TODO__ in the [student lab notebook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/machine_learning/deepdive2/ml_on_gcloud_v2/labs/03_adv_tfdv_facets.ipynb) -- try to complete that notebook first before reviewing this solution notebook."

    "The Civil Comments dataset comprises approximately 2 million public comments that were submitted to the Civil Comments platform. [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.google.com/) sponsored the effort to compile and annotate these comments for ongoing [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04561); they've also hosted competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification) to help classify toxic comments as well as minimize unintended model bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Civil Comments data, a subset of comments are tagged with a variety of identity attributes pertaining to gender, sexual orientation, religion, race, and ethnicity. Each identity annotation column contains a value that represents the percentage of annotators who categorized a comment as containing references to that identity. Multiple identities may be present in a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** These identity attributes are intended *for evaluation purposes only*, to assess how well a classifier trained solely on the comment text performs on different tag sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect these identity labels, each comment was reviewed by up to 10 annotators, who were asked to indicate all identities that were mentioned in the comment. For example, annotators were posed the question: \"What genders are mentioned in the comment?\", and asked to choose all of the following categories that were applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Male\n",
    "* Female\n",
    "* Transgender\n",
    "* Other gender\n",
    "* No gender mentioned\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** *We recognize the limitations of the categories used in the original dataset, and acknowledge that these terms do not encompass the full range of vocabulary used in describing gender.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Jigsaw used these ratings to generate an aggregate score for each identity attribute representing the percentage of raters who said the identity was mentioned in the comment. For example, if 10 annotators reviewed a comment, and 6 said that the comment mentioned the identity \"female\" and 0 said that the comment mentioned the identity \"male,\" the comment would receive a `female` score of `0.6` and a `male` score of `0.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For the purposes of annotation, a comment was considered to \"mention\" gender if it contained a comment about gender issues (e.g., a discussion about feminism, wage gap between men and women, transgender rights, etc.), gendered language, or gendered insults. Use of \"he,\" \"she,\" or gendered names (e.g., Donald, Margaret) did not require a gender label. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Label\n",
    "\n",
    "Each comment was rated by up to 10 annotators for toxicity, who each classified it with one of the following ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very Toxic\n",
    "* Toxic\n",
    "* Hard to Say\n",
    "* Not Toxic\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, Jigsaw used these ratings to generate an aggregate toxicity \"score\" for each comment (ranging from `0.0` to `1.0`) to serve as the [label](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary?utm_source=Colab&utm_medium=fi-colab&utm_campaign=fi-practicum&utm_content=glossary&utm_term=label#label), representing the fraction of annotators who labeled the comment either \"Very Toxic\" or \"Toxic.\" For example, if 10 annotators rated a comment, and 3 of them labeled it \"Very Toxic\" and 5 of them labeled it \"Toxic\", the comment would receive a toxicity score of `0.8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For more information on the Civil Comments labeling schema, see the [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data) section of the Jigsaw Untended Bias in Toxicity Classification Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing the data\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, we converted toxicity and identity columns to booleans in order to work with our neural net and metrics calculations. In the preprocessed dataset, we considered any value ≥ 0.5 as True (i.e., a comment is considered toxic if 50% or more crowd raters labeled it as toxic).\n",
    "\n",
    "For identity labels, the threshold 0.5 was chosen and the identities were grouped together by their categories. For example, if one comment has `{ male: 0.3, female: 1.0, transgender: 0.0, heterosexual: 0.8, homosexual_gay_or_lesbian: 1.0 }`, after processing, the data will be `{ gender: [female], sexual_orientation: [heterosexual, homosexual_gay_or_lesbian] }`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Missing identity fields were converted to False.\n"
