    "# Performing the Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**\n",
    "1. Learn how to use `cloudml-hypertune` to report the results for Cloud hyperparameter tuning trial runs\n",
    "2. Learn how to configure the `.yaml` file for submitting a Cloud hyperparameter tuning job\n",
    "3. Submit a hyperparameter tuning job to Cloud AI Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if we can improve upon that by tuning our hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are parameters that are set *prior* to training a model, as opposed to parameters which are learned *during* training. \n",
    "\n",
    "These include learning rate and batch size, but also model design parameters such as type of activation function and number of hidden units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the four most common ways to finding the ideal hyperparameters:\n",
    "1. Manual\n",
    "2. Grid Search\n",
    "3. Random Search\n",
    "4. Bayesian Optimzation\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Manual**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, hyperparameter tuning is a manual trial and error process. A data scientist has some intution about suitable hyperparameters which they use as a starting point, then they observe the result and use that information to try a new set of hyperparameters to try to beat the existing performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pros\n",
    "- Educational, builds up your intuition as a data scientist\n",
    "- Inexpensive because only one trial is conducted at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons\n",
    "- Requires alot of time and patience\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Grid Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other extreme we can use grid search. Define a discrete set of values to try for each hyperparameter then try every possible combination. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pros\n",
    "- Can run hundreds of trials in parallel using the cloud\n",
    "- Gauranteed to find the best solution within the search space\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons\n",
    "- Expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Random Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively define a range for each hyperparamter (e.g. 0-256) and sample uniformly at random from that range. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pros\n",
    "- Can run hundreds of trials in parallel using the cloud\n",
    "- Requires less trials than Grid Search to find a good solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons\n",
    "- Expensive (but less so than Grid Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Bayesian Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Grid Search and Random Search, Bayesian Optimization takes into account information from  past trials to select parameters for future trials. The details of how this is done is beyond the scope of this notebook, but if you're interested you can read how it works here [here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/hyperparameter-tuning-cloud-machine-learning-engine-using-bayesian-optimization). \n",
    "\n",
    "Pros\n",
    "- Picks values intelligenty based on results from past trials\n",
    "- Less expensive because requires fewer trials to get a good result\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons\n",
    "- Requires sequential trials for best results, takes longer\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Platform HyperTune**\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Platform HyperTune, powered by [Google Vizier](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46180), uses Bayesian Optimization by default, but [also supports](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/hyperparameter-tuning-overview#search_algorithms) Grid Search and Random Search. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When tuning just a few hyperparameters (say less than 4), Grid Search and Random Search work well, but when tunining several hyperparameters and the search space is large Bayesian Optimization is best."
