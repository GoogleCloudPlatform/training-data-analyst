    "\n",
    "Before you use your model to make predictions, you need to deploy it to an `Endpoint`. You can do this by calling the `deploy` function on the `Model` resource. This will do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an `Endpoint` resource for deploying the `Model` resource to.\n",
    "2. Deploy the `Model` resource to the `Endpoint` resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `deployed_model_display_name`: A human readable name for the deployed model.\n",
    "- `traffic_split`: Percent of traffic at the endpoint that goes to this model, which is specified as a dictionary of one or more key/value pairs.\n",
    "   - If only one model, then specify as **{ \"0\": 100 }**, where \"0\" refers to this model being uploaded and 100 means 100% of the traffic.\n",
    "   - If there are existing models on the endpoint, for which the traffic will be split, then use `model_id` to specify as **{ \"0\": percent, model_id: percent, ... }**, where `model_id` is the model id of an existing model to the deployed endpoint. The percents must add up to 100.\n",
    "- `machine_type`: The type of machine to use for training.\n",
    "- `accelerator_type`: The hardware accelerator type.\n",
    "- `accelerator_count`: The number of accelerators to attach to a worker replica.\n",
    "- `starting_replica_count`: The number of compute instances to initially provision.\n",
    "- `max_replica_count`: The maximum number of compute instances to scale to. In this tutorial, only one instance is provisioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traffic split\n",
    "\n",
    "The `traffic_split` parameter is specified as a Python dictionary. You can deploy more than one instance of your model to an endpoint, and then set the percentage of traffic that goes to each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a traffic split to introduce a new model gradually into production. For example, if you had one existing model in production with 100% of the traffic, you could deploy a new model to the same endpoint, direct 10% of traffic to it, and reduce the original model's traffic to 90%. This allows you to monitor the new model's performance while minimizing the disruption to the majority of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compute instance scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify a single instance (or node) to serve your online prediction requests. This tutorial uses a single node, so the variables `MIN_NODES` and `MAX_NODES` are both set to `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use multiple nodes to serve your online prediction requests, set `MAX_NODES` to the maximum number of nodes you want to use. Vertex AI autoscales the number of nodes used to serve your predictions, up to the maximum number you set. Refer to the [pricing page](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#prediction-prices) to understand the costs of autoscaling with multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "The method will block until the model is deployed and eventually return an `Endpoint` object. If this is the first time a model is deployed to the endpoint, it may take a few additional minutes to complete provisioning of resources."
