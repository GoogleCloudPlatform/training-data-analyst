    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a Vertex AI model training job.\n",
    "* Train an AutoML tabular model.\n",
    "* Deploy the `model` resource to a serving `endpoint` resource.\n",
    "* Make a prediction by sending data.\n",
    "* Undeploy the `model` resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will use Vertex AI Python client library to train and make predictions on an AutoML model based on a tabular dataset. Alternatively, you can train and make predictions on models by using the gcloud command-line tool or by using the online Cloud Console.\n",
    "\n",
