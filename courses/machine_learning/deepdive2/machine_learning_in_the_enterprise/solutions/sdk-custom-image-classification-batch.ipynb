    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learn how to use the Vertex SDK for Python to train and deploy a custom image classification model for batch prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a Vertex AI custom job for training a model.\n",
    "* Train a TensorFlow model.\n",
    "* Make a batch prediction.\n",
    "* Clean up resources.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will create a custom-trained model from a Python script in a Docker container using the Vertex SDK for Python, and then do a prediction on the deployed model by sending data. Alternatively, you can create custom-trained models using gcloud command-line tool, or online using the Cloud Console.\n",
