    "# Deploying a Kubeflow Cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\n",
    "This notebook provides instructions for setting up a Kubeflow cluster on GCP using the command-line interface (CLI). For additional help, see the guide to [deploying Kubeflow using the CLI](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possible alternatives:\n",
    "- The first alternative is to deploy Kubeflow cluster using the [Kubeflow deployment web app](https://deploy.kubeflow.cloud/), and the instruction can be found [here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-ui/).\n",
    "- Another alternative is to use recently launched [AI Platform Pipeline](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/docs/introduction). But, it is important to note that the AI Platform Pipeline is a standalone [Kubeflow Pipeline](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/overview/pipelines-overview/) deployment, where a lot of the components in full Kubeflow deployment won't be pre-installed. The instruction can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/docs/setting-up).\n",

    "The CLI deployment gives you more control over the deployment process and configuration than you get if you use the deployment UI."
