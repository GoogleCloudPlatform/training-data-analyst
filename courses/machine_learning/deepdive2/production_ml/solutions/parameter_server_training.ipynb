    "\n",
    "[Parameter server training](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-li_mu.pdf)\n",
    "is a common data-parallel method to scale up model training on multiple\n",
    "machines. A parameter server training cluster consists of workers and parameter\n",
    "servers. Variables are created on parameter servers and they are read and updated by workers in each step. By default, workers read and update these variables independently without synchronizing with each other. This is why sometimes parameter server-style training is called asynchronous training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TF2, parameter server training is powered by the\n",
    "`tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` class, which distributes\n",
    "the training steps to a cluster that scales up to thousands of workers\n",
    "(accompanied by parameter servers). There are two main supported training APIs:\n",
    "Keras Training API, also known as `Model.fit`, and Custom Training Loop (CTL).\n",
    "`Model.fit` is recommended when users prefer a high-level abstraction\n",
    "and handling of training, while CTL is recommended when users prefer to define the details of their training\n",
    "loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the API of choice, distributed training in TF2 involves a\n",
    "\"cluster\" with several \"jobs\", and each of the jobs may have one or more\n",
    "\"tasks\". When using parameter server training, it is recommended to have one\n",
    "coordinator job (which has the job name `chief`), multiple worker jobs (job name\n",
    "`worker`), and multiple parameter server jobs (job name `ps`).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the coordinator creates resources, dispatches training tasks, writes\n",
    "checkpoints, and deals with task failures, workers and parameter servers run `tf.distribute.Server` that listen for requests from the coordinator."

    "### Parameter server training with `Model.fit` API\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter server training with `Model.fit` API requires the coordinator to use a `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` object, and a `tf.keras.utils.experimental.DatasetCreator` as the input. Similar to `Model.fit` usage with no strategy, or with other strategies, the workflow\n",
    "involves creating and compiling the model, preparing the callbacks, followed by a `Model.fit` call.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter server training with custom training loop (CTL) API\n",
    "\n",
    "With CTLs, the `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.ClusterCoordinator`\n",
    "class is the key component used for the coordinator. The `ClusterCoordinator`\n",
    "class needs to work in conjunction with a `tf.distribute.Strategy` object. This\n",
    "`tf.distribute.Strategy` object is needed to provide the information of the cluster and is used to define a training step as we have seen in [custom training with `MirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/custom_training#training_loop). The `ClusterCoordinator` object then dispatches the execution of these training\n",
    "steps to remote workers. For parameter server training, the `ClusterCoordinator`\n",
    "needs to work with a `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important API provided by the `ClusterCoordinator` object is `schedule`. The `schedule` API enqueues a `tf.function` and returns a future-like `RemoteValue` immediately. The queued functions will be dispatched to remote workers in background threads and their `RemoteValue`s will be filled asynchronously. Since `schedule` doesn’t require worker assignment, the `tf.function` passed in can be executed on any available worker. If the worker it is executed on becomes unavailable before its completion, the function will be retried on another available worker. Because of this fact and the fact that function execution is not atomic, a function may be executed more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to dispatching remote functions, the `ClusterCoordinator` also helps\n",
    "to create datasets on all the workers and rebuild these datasets when a worker recovers from failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each learning objective will correspond to a _#TODO_ in this student lab notebook -- try to complete this notebook first and then review the [solution notebook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/machine_learning/deepdive2/recommendation_systems/soulutions/parameter_server_training.ipynb)"

    "\n",
    "There are several possible reasons if you see performance issues when you train\n",
    "with `ParameterServerStrategy` and `ClusterResolver`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common reason is parameter servers have unbalanced load and some\n",
    "heavily-loaded parameter servers have reached capacity. There can also be\n",
    "multiple root causes. Some simple methods to mitigate this issue are to\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  shard your large model variables via specifying a `variable_partitioner`\n",
    "    when constructing a `ParameterServerStrategy`.\n",
    "2.  avoid creating a hotspot variable that is required by all parameter servers\n",
    "    in a single step if possible. For example, use a constant learning rate\n",
    "    or subclass `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule` in\n",
    "    optimizers since the default behavior is that the learning rate will become\n",
    "    a variable placed on a particular parameter server and requested by all\n",
    "    other parameter servers in each step.\n",
    "3.  shuffle your large vocabularies before passing them to Keras preprocessing\n",
    "    layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible reason for performance issues is the coordinator. Our first\n",
    "implementation of `schedule`/`join` is Python-based and thus may have threading\n",
    "overhead. Also the latency between the coordinator and the workers can be large.\n",
    "If this is the case,\n",
    "\n",
    "*   For `Model.fit`, you can set `steps_per_execution` argument provided at\n",
    "    `Model.compile` to a value larger than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   For CTLs, you can pack multiple steps into a single `tf.function`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "steps_per_invocation = 10\n",

    "Most of the known limitations are covered in above sections. This section\n",

    "\n",
    "### `ParameterServerStrategy` general\n",
    "\n",
    "* `os.environment[\"grpc_fail_fast\"]=\"use_caller\"` is needed on every task, including the coordinator, to make fault tolerance work properly. \n",
    "* Synchronous parameter server training is not supported.\n",
    "* It is usually necessary to pack multiple steps into a single function to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "* It is not supported to load a saved_model via `tf.saved_model.load` containing sharded variables. Note loading such a saved_model using TensorFlow Serving is expected to work.\n",
    "* It is not supported to load a checkpoint containg sharded optimizer slot variables into a different number of shards.\n",
    "* It is not supported to recover from parameter server failure without restarting the coordinator task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Model.fit` specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `steps_per_epoch` argument is required in `Model.fit`. You can select a\n",
    "    value that provides appropriate intervals in an epoch.\n",
    "*   `ParameterServerStrategy` does not have support for custom callbacks that\n",
    "    have batch-level calls for performance reason. You should convert those\n",
    "    calls into epoch-level calls with suitably picked `steps_per_epoch`, so that\n",
    "    they are called every `steps_per_epoch` number of steps. Built-in callbacks\n",
    "    are not affected: their batch-level calls have been modified to be\n",
    "    performant. Supporting batch-level calls for `ParameterServerStrategy` is\n",
    "    being planned.\n",
    "*   For the same reason, unlike other strategies, progress bar and metrics are\n",

    "### Custom Training Loop specifics\n",

    "*   `ClusterCoordinator.schedule` doesn't support visitation guarantees for a dataset.\n",
    "*   When `ClusterCoordinator.create_per_worker_dataset` is used, the whole dataset must be created inside the function passed to it.\n",
