    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`tf.distribute.Strategy` is a TensorFlow API to distribute training \n",
    "across multiple GPUs, multiple machines or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`tf.distribute.Strategy` has been designed with these key goals in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to use and support multiple user segments, including researchers, ML engineers, etc.\n",
    "* Provide good performance out of the box.\n",
    "* Easy switching between strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "`tf.distribute.Strategy` can be used with a high-level API like [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras), and can also be used to distribute custom training loops (and, in general, any computation using TensorFlow).\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow 2.x, you can execute your programs eagerly, or in a graph using [`tf.function`](function.ipynb). `tf.distribute.Strategy` intends to support both these modes of execution, but works best with `tf.function`. Eager mode is only recommended for debugging purpose and not supported for `TPUStrategy`. Although training is the focus of this guide, this API can also be used for distributing evaluation and prediction on different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `tf.distribute.Strategy` with very few changes to your code, because we have changed the underlying components of TensorFlow to become strategy-aware. This includes variables, layers, models, optimizers, metrics, summaries, and checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we explain various types of strategies and how you can use them in different situations. To learn how to debug performance issues, see the [Optimize TensorFlow GPU Performance](gpu_performance_analysis.md) guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For a deeper understanding of the concepts, please watch [this deep-dive presentation](https://youtu.be/jKV53r9-H14). This is especially recommended if you plan to write your own training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each learning objective will correspond to a __#TODO__ in the [student lab notebook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/machine_learning/deepdive2/production_ml/labs/distributed_training_with_TF.ipynb) -- try to complete that notebook first before reviewing this solution notebook.\n"

    "* *Synchronous vs asynchronous training:* These are two common ways of distributing training with data parallelism. In sync training, all workers train over different slices of input data in sync, and aggregating gradients at each step. In async training, all workers are independently training over the input data and updating variables asynchronously. Typically sync training is supported via all-reduce and async through parameter server architecture.\n",

It used the `tf.distribute.Strategy.reduce` API to aggregate the results returned by `tf.distribute.Strategy.run`. `tf.distribute.Strategy.run` returns results from each local replica in the strategy, and there are multiple ways to consume this result. You can `reduce` them to get an aggregated value. You can also do `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_local_results` to get the list of values contained in the result, one per local replica.\n",
