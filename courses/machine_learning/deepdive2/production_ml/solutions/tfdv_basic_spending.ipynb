    "## Introduction \n",
    "This lab is an introduction to TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV), a key component of TensorFlow Extended.  This lab serves as a foundation for understanding the features of TFDV and how it can help you understand, validate, and monitor your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "TFDV can be used for generating schemas and statistics about the distribution of every feature in the dataset. Such information is useful for comparing multiple datasets (e.g. training vs inference datasets) and reporting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical differences in the features distribution\n",
    "TFDV also offers visualization capabilities for comparing datasets based on the Google PAIR Facets project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each learning objective will correspond to a __#TODO__ in the [student lab notebook](../labs/tfdv_basic_spending.ipynb) -- try to complete that notebook first before reviewing this solution notebook."

    "Now let's use [`tfdv.infer_schema`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/api_docs/python/tfdv/infer_schema) to create a schema for our data.  A schema defines constraints for the data that are relevant for ML. Example constraints include the data type of each feature, whether it's numerical or categorical, or the frequency of its presence in the data.  For categorical features the schema also defines the domain - the list of acceptable values.  Since writing a schema can be a tedious task, especially for datasets with lots of features, TFDV provides a method to generate an initial version of the schema based on the descriptive statistics.\n",
