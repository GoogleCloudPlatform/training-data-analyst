Demo: Creating a Classification Model in BigQuery

1. Open BigQuery: https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery

2. Create a dataset titled ecommerce (if not done already)

3. Review the ML model + the training data we are feeding in

Model objective: Classify a return visitor as whether they will make a purchase or not

Features:
1) Whether they bounce (leave immediately) : totals.bounces
2) How much time they spend on the website : totals.timeOnSite

*/

# select initial features and label to feed into our model
SELECT
  bounces,
  time_on_site,
  will_buy_on_return_visit # <--- our label
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
ORDER BY time_on_site DESC # order by most time spent first

/*

Discussion: Do you think these two features will be enough for our model
to learn whether or not a visitor buys? Why or why not?

Let's add our SQL code to create the model:

*/  

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS

#standardSQL
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
;

While the model trains (usually takes 5 mins or less, which is fast for ML)

But, you don't need to wait. We've already trained the same model for you to evaluate below:

*/

SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `data-to-insights.ecommerce.classification_model`,  (

SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630') # eval on 2 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM

  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)

));

How does our model perform? Not great! 

What could you do in your upcoming lab to make it perform better?

What other fields would you add as potential features?

Summary: Creating ML models is easy. Creating good ML models is hard
