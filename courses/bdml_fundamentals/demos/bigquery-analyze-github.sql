# BigQuery discussion:
# after query is ran, select Execution details to compare Elapsed time (20s) vs Slot time consumed (30+ minutes)
# Ask: We know we only waited about 20 seconds for the results. What's this 30+ minute number mean then?

# Inside of the BigQuery service are lots of virtual machines that massively process 
# your data and query logic in parallel. These workers or "slots" work together to process a single query job
# really quickly. For accounts with on-demand pricing, you can have up to 2,000 slots

# So say we had 30 minutes of slot time or 1800 seconds. If the query took 20 seconds in total to run, 
# but it was 1800 seconds worth of work, how many workers at minimum worked on it? 1800/20 = 90
# And that's assuming each worker instantly had all the data it needed and was at full capacity for all 20 seconds
# In reality, workers have a variety of tasks (waiting for data, reading it, performing computations, and writing data)
# and also need to compare notes with eachother on what work was already done on the job. The good news for you is
# that you don't need to worry about optimizing these workers or the underlying data to run perfectly in parallel. That's
# why BigQuery is a managed service -- there's an entire team dedicated to hardware and data storage optimization.

# In case you were wondering, the worker limit for your project is 2,000 slots at once. As a general rule, 
# if you're processing less than 100 GB of queries all at once, you're unlikely to be using all 2,000 slots.

# If you're really interested in BigQuery performance (say you have a team of 100 analysts and want to monitor usage)
# you can monitor usage with StackDriver: https://app.google.stackdriver.com/services/bigquery?project=bdml-demos

# We can now see we used about 50-100 slots for the previous query.
