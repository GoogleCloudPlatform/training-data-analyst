## Project Overview 📖
In this project, our team set up Cloud Shell as our development environment, then updated the application code to integrate Cloud Datastore. The quiz application is to upload an image file into Cloud Storage and view the image in the quiz.

## Scope of Work 🔍
Using GitHub to clone and work on the code of a quiz application to intermix into Cloud Store.

## Methodology ⚙️
Cloned GitHub with python code for the purpose of creating a base quiz application to be altered to be used at a later time; which would implement images, and video.
