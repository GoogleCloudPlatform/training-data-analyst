These models are trained on a vast amount text data and can generate high-quality responses to a wide range of questions. One thing to note here is that most models have cutoff dates regarding their knowledge, and asking anything too recent might yield an incomplete, imaginative or incorrect answer (i.e. a hallucination).\n",

    "For example, you can observe the question \"What is the name of the Earth's largest ocean?\" and see that model predicted  \"Pacific Ocean\" when a ground truth label is \"The Pacific Ocean\" with the extra \"The.\" Now, if you use the simple classification metrics, then you will consider this as a wrong prediction since original and predicted strings have a difference.

The ratio raw score measures the string's similarity as an int in the range [0, 100]. For two strings X and Y, the score is defined by int(round((2.0 * M / T) * 100)) where T is the total number of characters in both strings, and M is the number of matches in the two strings. \n",
