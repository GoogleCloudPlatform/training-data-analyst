    "## Overview\n",
    "Text summarization produces a concise and fluent summary of a longer text document. There are two main text summarization types: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization involves selecting critical sentences from the original text and combining them to form a summary. Abstractive summarization involves generating new sentences representing the original text's main points. In this notebook, you go through a few examples of how large language models can help with generating summaries based on text more specifically generating concise summaries of house listing.\n",
