    "You were recently hired as a Machine Learning Engineer at a startup movie review website. Your manager has tasked you with building a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of user movie reviews as positive or negative. These predictions will be used as an input in downstream movie rating systems and to surface top supportive and critical reviews on the movie website application. The challenge: your business requirements are that you have just 6 weeks to productionize a model that achieves great than 75% accuracy to improve upon an existing bootstrapped solution. Furthermore, after doing some exploratory analysis in your startup's data warehouse, you found that you only have a small dataset of 50k text reviews to build a higher performing solution.\n",

Lastly, you will define and run a Kubeflow Pipeline on Vertex Pipelines that trains and deploys your model to a Vertex Endpoint that you will query for online predictions."

First, you built, trained, and evaluated a BERT sentiment classifier model in a Vertex Notebook. You then packaged your model code into a Docker container to train on Google Cloud's Vertex AI. Lastly, you defined and ran a Kubeflow Pipeline on Vertex Pipelines that trained and deployed your model container to a Vertex Endpoint that you queried for online predictions."
