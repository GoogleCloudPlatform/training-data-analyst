    "| Hungry | .5 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| Full | -1 | -.5 | 1.5 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead for Policy Gradients, we can imagine that we have a similar table, but instead of recording the values, we'll keep track of the probability to take the column action given the row state.\n",

    "| Full | 5% | 15% | 80% |\n",
    "\n",
    "With Q learning, whenever we take one step in our environment, we can update the value of the old state based on the value of the new state plus any rewards we picked up based on the [Q equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning):\n",

Instead, we'll use a different <a href=\"http://incompleteideas.net/papers/sutton-88-with-erratum.pdf\"> Temporal Difference Learning</a> strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q Learning is an evolution of TD(0), and for Policy Gradients, we'll use TD(1). We'll calculate TD(1) accross and entire episode, and use that to indicate whether to increase or decrease the probability correspoding to the action we took. Let's look at a full day of eating.\n",
