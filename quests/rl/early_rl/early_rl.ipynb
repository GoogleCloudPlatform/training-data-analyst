    "# Early Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advances of modern computing power, the study of Reinforcement Learning is having a heyday. Machines are now able to learn complex tasks once thought to be solely in the domain of humans, from controlling the [heating and cooling in massive data centers](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611902/google-just-gave-control-over-data-center-cooling-to-an-ai/) to beating [grandmasters at Starcraft](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/research/alphastar/AlphaStar_unformatted.pdf). As magnificent as it may seem today, it had humble roots many decades ago. Seeing how far it's come, it's a wonder to see how far it will go!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a step back in time to see how these early algorithms developed. Many of these algorithms make sense given the context of when they were created. Challenge yourself and see if you can come up with the same strategies given the right problem. Ok! Time to cozy up for a story.\n",

    "\n",
    "The lake can be thought of as a 4 x 4 grid where the gumdrop can move left (0), down (1), right (2) and up (3). Unfortunately, this frozen lake of death has holes of death where if the gumdrop enters that square, it will fall in and meet an untimely demise. To make matters worse, the lake is surrounded by icy boulders that if the gumdrop attempts to climb, will have it slip back into its original position. Thankfully, at the bottom right of the lake is a safe ramp that leads to a nice warm cup of hot cocoa.\n",

    "## Value Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's turn the clock back on our time machines to 1957 to meet Mr. [Richard Bellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Bellman). Bellman started his academic career in mathematics, but due to World War II, left his postgraduate studies at John Hopkins to teach electronics as part of the war effort (as chronicled by J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson [here](https://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bellman.html)). When the war was over, and it came time for him to focus on his next area of research, he became fascinated with [Dynamic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming): the idea of breaking a problem down into sub-problems and using recursion to solve the larger problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, his research landed him on [Markov Decision Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process). These processes are a graphical way of representing how to make a decision based on a current state. States are connected to other states with positive and negative rewards that can be picked up along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound familiar at all? Perhaps our Frozen Lake?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lake case, each cell is a state. The `H`s and the `G` are a special type of state called a \"Terminal State\", meaning they can be entered, but they have no leaving connections. What of rewards? Let's say the value of losing our life is the negative opposite of getting to the goal and staying alive. Thus, we can assign the reward of entering a death hole as -1, and the reward of escaping as +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bellman's first breakthrough with this type of problem is now known as Value Iteration ([his original paper](http://www.iumj.indiana.edu/IUMJ/FULLTEXT/1957/6/56038)). He introduced a variable, gamma (γ), to represent discounted future rewards. He also introduced a function of policy (π) that takes a state (s), and outputs corresponding suggested action (a). The goal is to find the value of a state (V), given the rewards that occur when following an action in a particular state (R).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma, the discount, is the key ingredient here. If my time steps were in days, and my gamma was .9, `$100` would be worth `$100` to me today, `$90` tomorrow, `$81` the day after, and so on. Putting this all together, we get the Bellman Equation\n",

    "\n",
    "source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the value of our current state, `current_values`, is equal to the discount times the value of the next state, `next_values`, given the policy the agent will follow. For now, we'll have our agent assume a greedy policy: it will move towards the state with the highest calculated value. If you're wondering what P is, don't worry, we'll get to that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's program it out and see it in action! We'll set up an array representing the lake with -1 as the holes, and 1 as the goal. Then, we'll set up an array of zeros to start our iteration."
