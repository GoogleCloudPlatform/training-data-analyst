You will need to click on the model name in order to see the spinner/checkmark. In the command above, notice we specify `prediction-class`. The reason we must specify a prediction class is that by default, AI Platform prediction will call a Scikit-Learn model's `predict` method, which in this case returns either 0 or 1. However, the What-If Tool requires output from a model in line with a Scikit-Learn model's `predict_proba` method.  This is because WIT wants the probabilities of the negative and positive classes, not just the final determination on which class a person belongs to. Because that allows us to do more fine-grained exploration of the model. Consequently, we must write a [custom prediction routine](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/custom-prediction-routines) that basically renames `predict_proba` as `predict`. The custom prediction method can be found in the file `predictor.py`. This file was packaged in the section __Package custom transform code__.

Finally, navigate to the __Features__ tab in the What-if Tool. This shows you the distribution of values for each feature in your dataset. You can use this tab to make sure your dataset is balanced. For example, if we only had Asians in a population, the model's predictions wouldn't necessarily reflect real world data. This tab gives us a good opportunity to see where our dataset might fall short, so that we can go back and collect more data to make it balanced.\n",

We can see that of the 2000 test datapoints, 1346 are from men and 1702 are from caucasions. Women and minorities seem under-represented in this dataset. That may lead to the model not learning an accurate representation of the world in which it is trying to make predictions (of course, even if it does learn an accurate representation, is that what we want the model to perpetuate? This is a much deeper question still falling under the ML fairness umbrella and worthy of discussion outside of WIT). Predictions on those under-represented groups are more likely to be inaccurate than predictions on the over-represented groups.\n",

For example, setting this to `sex` allows us to see the breakdown of model performance on male datapoints versus female datapoints. We can see that the model is more accurate (has less false positives and false negatives) on females than males. We can also see that the model predicts high income for females much less than it does for males (8.0% of the time for females vs 27.1% of the time for males). __Note, your numbers will be slightly different due to the random elements of model training__.\n",

In this case, 28% of men from the test dataset have their loans approved but only 10% of women have theirs approved. If we wished to ensure than men and women get their loans approved the same percentage of the time, that is a fairness concept called \"demographic parity\". One way to achieve demographic parity would be to have different classification thresholds for males and females in our model.\n",

    "In this case, demographic parity can be found with both groups getting loans 16% of the time by having the male threshold at 0.67 and the female threshold at 0.31. Because of the vast difference in the properties of the male and female training data in this 1994 census dataset, we need quite different thresholds to achieve demographic parity. Notice how with the high male threshold there are many more false negatives than before, and with the low female threshold there are many more false positives than before. This is necessary to get the percentage of positive predictions to be equal between the two groups. WIT has buttons to optimize for other fairness constraints as well, such as \"equal opportunity\" and \"equal accuracy\". Note that the demographic parity numbers may be different from the ones in your text as the trained models are always a bit different.\n",

    "The use of these features can help shed light on subsets of your data on which your classifier is performing very differently. Understanding biases in your datasets and data slices on which your model has disparate performance are very important parts of analyzing a model for fairness. There are many approaches to improving fairness, including augmenting training data, building fairness-related loss functions into your model training procedure, and post-training inference adjustments like those seen in WIT. We think that WIT provides a great interface for furthering ML fairness learning, but of course there is no silver bullet to improving ML fairness."
