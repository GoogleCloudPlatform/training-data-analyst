    "# Lab 1: Explore and Benchmark a BigQuery Dataset for Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will take an existing 2TB+ [TPC-DS benchmark dataset](http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-ds_v2.10.0.pdf) and learn the data warehouse optimization methods you can apply to the dataset in BigQuery to improve performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What you'll do\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use BigQuery to access and query the TPC-DS benchmark dataset\n",
    "- Run pre-defined queries to establish baseline performance benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an __advanced level SQL__ lab. Before taking it, you should have experience with SQL. Familiarity with BigQuery is also highly recommended. If you need to get up to speed in these areas, you should take this Data Analyst series of labs first:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Quest: BigQuery for Data Analysts](https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/55)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're ready, scroll down to learn about the services you will be using and how to properly set up your lab environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BigQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without managing infrastructure or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and takes advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TPC-DS Background\n",
    "In order to benchmark the performance of a data warehouse we first must get tables and data to run queries against. There is a public organization, TPC, that provides large benchmarking datasets to companies explicitly for this purpose. The purpose of TPC benchmarks is to provide relevant, objective performance data to industry users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TPC-DS Dataset we will be using comprises of __25 tables__ and __99 queries__ that simulate common data analysis tasks. View the full documentation [here](http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-ds_v2.11.0.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring TPC-DS in BigQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "The TPC-DS tables have been loaded into BigQuery and you will explore ways to optimize the performance of common queries by using BigQuery data warehousing best practices. We have limited the size to 2TB for the timing of this lab but the dataset itself can be expanded as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The TPC Benchmark and TPC-DS are trademarks of the Transaction Processing Performance Council (http://www.tpc.org). The Cloud DW benchmark is derived from the TPC-DS Benchmark and as such is not comparable to published TPC-DS results."
