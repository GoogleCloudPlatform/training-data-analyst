    "In Teradata, a unique index can be used to prevent rows with non-unique keys in a table. If a process tries to insert or update data that has a value that's already in the index, the operation either fails with an index violation (`MULTISET` tables) or silently ignores it (`SET` tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because BigQuery doesn't provide explicit indexes, other strategies can be employed to achieve the same effect. A `MERGE` statement can be used instead to insert only unique records into a target table from a staging table while discarding duplicate records. However, there is no way to prevent a user with edit permissions from inserting a duplicate record, because BigQuery never locks during `INSERT` operations. To generate an error for duplicate records in BigQuery, you can use a `MERGE` statement from a staging table, as shown in the following example."
