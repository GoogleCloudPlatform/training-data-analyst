    "\n",
    "The \"avg_slots\" metric indicates the average number of slots being utilized by your query at any given time. Often, portions of the query plan will have different amounts of parallelism and thus can benefit (or not) from more slots. For example, if you're performing a basic READ+FILTER+AGGREGATE query, reading data from a large table may require 1,000 slost for the `INPUT` phase since each slot reads a file, but if a lot of the data is immediately filtered, there may be fewer slots or even one slot needed for the next stage to aggregate. Certain portions of your queries may become bottlenecks for parallelism, for example, `JOIN`s, `SORT`s, etc. BigQuery can execute many of these in a parallel manner and optimizing this queries is a more advanced topic. At this point, it's important to know slot_time, and conceptually what a slot is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you were wondering, the worker limit for your project is 2,000 slots at once. In a production setting, this will vary depending on whether your organization is using \"flat-rate\" pricing on \"on-demand\". If you're \"flat-rate\", the amount of slots will depend on the organization's reservation, how that reservations is apportioned to different folders, projects, and teams, and how busy each slice of the reservation is at any given moment."
